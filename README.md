# Responsive_Portfolio

Statement -
Web developers/Designers and UI/UX developers often have portfolio websites which
help them showcase their work to general public. 
Here are a few example of portfolio websites -
1) ​ http://nickboes.com/
2) ​ http://rusadrian.com/

As you can see, these websites showcase personal information of the person, contact
details and the work they have done in form of projects.

You are required to create a single page website of your own which will serve as your portfolio. It should
have the following sections at minimum -

1) A section describing yourself with your photo. You are allowed to write anything
about you including your hobbies etc.

2) A section describing your interests in technologies. You can write names of all
the technologies that you are interested in learning now and in future. You may
use icons and images etc to make the view more appealing.

3) A section describing your professional experience(if you have any) till now.

4) A project section which contains all the web related work you have done till now
(if you don’t have any, just mention this portfolio website itself that you are
creating).

You have to create this website and then push it to a github repository and then
host it using Github pages.

Important Points -
1) The webpage you develop should be fully responsive, taking care of all screen
sizes.
2) The font and images and other content on the page should adhere to responsive
design practices
3) Feel free to use colors, text,images etc according to your best judgement.
4) You are allowed to take ideas from external sources and other portfolio but do
not use any of their code.
